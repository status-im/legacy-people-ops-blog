Thank you for making security a priority and taking steps to secure your devices. This page has links to resources you might find helpful.

> In much the same way we’ve decentralized the organization and applications, we’ve done the same for security.
> It means the vast majority of the attack surface is you, the people that contribute. Furthermore, the controls and information a security specialist has in terms of making decisions and monitoring how things are run is constrained. It also means education takes a forward step in importance across the organization, and personal responsibility of quality security practices become paramount. It is up the people to understand potential threats, take preventative measures, and report any issues they come across to the security team to protect the organization as a whole.
