The Offsite is an annual event where all Status core contributors get together to learn, socialise, and strategise.

2017: Check out the archived recordings from [2017's Bangkok meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLgDUU2jlC0) for [impressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZABKaTumw0) of what you can expect.

2018: We all met up was in Prague and all particapate with #[cryptolife hackathon](https://hackathon.status.im/) & most attended DevCon4.
