## What is a feedback round?

A team getting together to share feedback on one another, facilitated by People Ops.

The goal is to surface recognition and insights on developmental areas.

## How does it work?

- We use a standard format (Google form) when collecting feedback, with one question: What should the swarm member Start, Stop, and Continue?
- [Optional] We’ll include a reference to role responsibilities or a self-evaluation for each person in the survey, so that feedback can be given that’s relevant to the role.

- If you want to use another format, we’re flexible - please ping @people-ops.

- Each participant gives feedback on all other members of the swarm. Participants can also ask anyone else in Status outside the swarm to give feedback by sending the feedback form to them.
- The feedback link can be posted publicly on Discuss if you’d like to open up feedback for proactive input from across Status.
- @people-ops will collect the feedback and will share it back to you.
- The swarm lead should then schedule a call for the swarm to reflect and discuss takeaways (not the feedback itself, but people are free to share that if they want to).
- You can always ping @people-ops if there is feedback you received or want to give that you want to discuss 1:1.

## Participants

All members of a swarm.

## Timelines

Day 0: Team/swarm lead or People Ops initiates feedback round

Day 1-2: Swarm members send role descriptions or self-evaluations to People Ops

Day 3-4: People Ops makes a plan and tailors the feedback form for the swarm

Day 4: Swarm members review the feedback round plan, let People Ops know if any other requirements

Day 5: People Ops notifies swarm members to complete feedback forms (giving feedback on everyone else in the swarm). Swarm members are also free to request feedback from people outside the swarm. Everyone has one-two weeks to write feedback

Day 19: People Ops collates feedback and shares with each participant

Day 20: Debrief call to reflect on feedback received.

End to end timeline - 4 weeks.

## How often?

No prescriptive schedule, but we recommend holding them at least twice a year. It’s also helpful to schedule in a follow-up 4-6 weeks after a feedback round to check in on how any development areas are going.

## FAQ

#### Why am I being asked to take part in multiple feedback rounds?

The nature of cross-functional swarms means that you may be involved in multiple teams. As such, you'll be invited to give feedback when any swarm you're involved in is having a feedback round. If you have nothing new to add, you're free not to participate.
