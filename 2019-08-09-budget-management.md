### What are the basics I should be aware of when managing the team's budget?

- Finance will work with leads to establish and maintain quarterly budgets
- Team leads are free to rearrange their existing budget differently (e.g. replace a software with another one) as long as it serves the purpose to reach the best outcome to the defined goals
- The teams get to keep (i.e. roll over) their funds if not everything is used as budgeted in the defined time frame
- For salary changes, team leads can make a suggestion to Carl/Jarrad, or ping People Ops. 
- If there are any changes in the budget file, leads should inform Finance. 
- For requesting additional budget, please use this [form](https://discord.com/channels/624205794384281629/755004302098956318/818503361405124670) . 

### Where do I track software subscriptions?

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ytUDqlg288_qQKWF6t2u00G9V5zcxXmXS1YThp9_R9s/edit#gid). This list is useful for both a cost tracking and access rights perspective. Please keep this list updated as the data in it is used as a source of truth for finance and People Ops purposes.

### I want to engage a third party vendor, how?

Reach out to POps/Finance for help in setting up contracting and invoicing with the vendor. Vendor costs should come out of the team budget; otherwise, please make a proposal to Finance

### What expenses can I approve and how does that work?

If the expense comes from your budget, it's up to your judgment.

Here are some related policies:

- [Getting approval for travel/events](__GHOST_URL__/events/) (NB: for larger events where there may be multiple CCs interested in going, please coordinate centrally with marketing so a decision can be made org-wide about who should attend.)
- [Expenses](__GHOST_URL__/filing-expenses/)
- [Travel insurance](__GHOST_URL__/travel-insurance/)
- [Travel expenses](__GHOST_URL__/travel-for-status/)

### What if a Â team member wants to relocate?

- [Immigration and relocation policy](__GHOST_URL__/visa-support/)

In most cases, we can't offer proactive visa support nor sponsorship. Please direct that person to speak to POps.
