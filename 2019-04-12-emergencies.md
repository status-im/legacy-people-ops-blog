### Updating your information

Please keep your emergency contact info in [BambooHR](https://statusim.bamboohr.com) up to date - we’ll use that information in case we ever need an emergency contact for you.

Navigate to 'My Info' > 'Emergency Contact' to maintain it.

It’s also helpful to review your contact phone number and email address from time to time, in case we need to reach you directly.

### Status emergency contacts

In all emergencies, contact [people-ops@status.im](mailto:people-ops@status.im) and the People Ops team will make contact with others (e.g. legal, security) on your behalf.

### Medical emergency

We don’t have a centralised medical emergency provision. We recommend that you get [travel insurance](__GHOST_URL__/travel-insurance/) out prior to any Status-sponsored travel, which usually includes emergency medical cover.

If you’re an employee of one of our entities, we may have to notify our employment liability insurer in some cases, and there may be emergency medical support provision available as part of this insurance. As such, we’d ask that you let us know if you get into any medical emergencies.

Please contact People Ops in case you find yourself in medical difficulties. We may not always be able to provide any assistance, but we’ll be happy to help with what we can, and can let your team know that you’ll be absent.

### Legal emergency

In the unlikely case you encounter any legal difficulties in connection with your employment or service providing relationship with Status, e.g.:

- Arrest or detention
- Receiving a notice or subpoena from a government authority
- Questioning at airports/country borders
- Contract disputes or lawsuits;

please contact us. We’ll do our best to support and guide you through whatever situation you’re faced with, and have a reserve set aside for this purpose.

### Crossing borders

Here are some general guidelines when crossing borders. 

- Prior to travelling, be aware of which countries may detain you and search your devices (even if only transiting through). The US and Canada are particularly known for this, though this applies in many other countries too. This is useful information to have so that you’re aware of your rights and what can/can’t legally be asked of you when crossing a border. Be mindful of what is on your devices.
- We’d always recommend complying with border officials and answering their questions truthfully.
- In case you get asked to supply passwords, or open devices, what you should do next really depends on the laws of the country, but generally speaking you have more rights and options if you are a citizen returning home, than a foreign national (who may not have a choice to decline). If you are a citizen, refusing to comply may lead to prolonged detention or having your device(s) seized. If you need legal advice, please ping us.
- If you have to give your password to a Status device to border officials, or have a device seized, please let us know so that we can review the security implications.
- Please be aware of the difference between a business trip and working, for immigration purposes, when travelling for Status. Telling a border official that you are coming to their country for “work” implies that you are doing revenue-generating activities in their country, i.e. that you would require a work permit. A “business trip” clarifies that your centre of economic activity remains outside the country and that you are merely visiting for short term purposes to do activities auxiliary to your job.
- Most countries will expect that you have an onwards flight within the period of your legal stay, and that you have at least 6 months’ remaining validity on your passport. You may want to renew your passport prior to travel if it expires soon, and avoid travelling on one way tickets.
- If you hold a passport that frequently runs up against increased border scrutiny, we’ll be happy to write you a letter for any Status-related trips you go on which explains your purpose in the country.
