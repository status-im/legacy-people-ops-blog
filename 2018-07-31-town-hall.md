*Streamed monthly on Status's Youtube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/statusim), the Town Hall is similar to an all-hands or all-company meeting, with each swarm giving a live update to our community.*

Catching up async? Watch the recording any time later on YouTube.

- 
Presenters should use the link in the calendar invite, and will be able to join the presenting room. Terry will assign presenters by tagging you in the slide deck on the Thursday before the Town Hall.

Check Discord channel #townhall-logistics for updates.

Attendance is not mandatory, you're free to watch live, catch a replay, or not at all. That said, the Town Hall is a good place to understand what's happening across Status, so we do recommend you try to be there or follow async.
