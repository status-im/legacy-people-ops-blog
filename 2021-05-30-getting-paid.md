**December pay**

As the holiday season affects the normal working days, the December payment run might be brought forward. Please be aware of date changes for the December payment run.

**Hourly rate contributors**

If you're paid on an hourly basis and need to estimate your hours in the remainder of the month and reconcile them in the next invoice (as you'll be invoicing by the 15th of each month), it's ok to do that, or you could carry forward actual hours to your next invoice.

If your fees have been agreed on an hourly rate basis, our monthly cap for hours billed is the lower of either the amount specified in your agreement with us, or the number of business days in the month x 8 hours per day, e.g.:

A month with 23 workdays has an hourly billing cap of 23 * 8 hours = 184 hours

Please have a discussion with People Ops if you intend to bill over this amount.

**Bank and Wallet Details**

Please maintain your details on your BambooHR profile, if you have one. For simplicity, we allow only the indication of one wallet and one bank account  (if you have intermediary accounts, this should be stated in the Notes of the Bank Information section). If you want to change the %age paid in ETH, DAI or SNT, you can directly edit it. Once you save it, it will send an approval request to the Finance team - the reason for that being so that we get a notification that something's changed, and can update our payment records timely. Only after the approval has been given will your changes reflect in your BambooHR profile, and only then you can change your payment split preferences again.

If you need a specific reference to complete this payment, please state it explicitly on your invoice.

**In order to make sure that your changes are considered for the current month, change your info by the 15th of each month. **

Please be sure that your employment contract or services agreement reflects your registered address for banking purposes, as we are sometimes asked by our bank to validate that banking details match contract details.

**Getting Paid in Crypto**

If you are new to crypto payments and wallets, this guide provides a good introduction.

To secure your assets, a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S or a Trezor is recommended.

Don’t be shy to ask your more experienced colleagues in the people ops channel when you have questions about crypto payments and wallets. Not everyone starts with the same level of knowledge and building it up is part of working with Status.

**Rate Calculation**

For determining rates when paying in crypto, the following two rates are established using coinmarketcap.com as a price source and the rate which is most attractive for the individual receiving crypto will be used:

The average closing rate across the last five days of the invoiced period.

Or

The current rate when payments are being issued.

Your split % preference can be changed monthly. Just make sure you update your preference on BambooHR by 15th of the month.

**Pro-rating the first month**

For your first month (if being paid on an annual or monthly basis), please prorate the amount in your invoice to reflect the actual days worked divided by the effective working days of that month, if you joined during the course of a month:

Example: If March has 23 working days (counting Mon-Fri) and you started on a Monday, March 12th, your monthly invoice amount will be {your monthly fee amount}/23 x 15.

For each subsequent month, please bill the flat monthly or annual/12 figure (regardless of the vacation/time off you took).

Example: You joined Status on March 12th. During April, you took 1 week of vacation. Your April invoice amount will be {your monthly stipend amount in full} or {your annual stipend amount}/12

Please use the working days shown below for your calculations:

**Expense Reimbursements**

From time to time, you might need to pay reimbursable expenses for the development of the project. To read more on how to get reimbursed for these expenses, please follow [this link](__GHOST_URL__/filing-expenses/).

**Swiss and German employees**

You will be paid via monthly payroll as calculated by our outsourced payroll partners. There is no need to submit an invoice for your monthly salary. Please maintain the percentages you wish to receive in crypto on your BambooHR profile, as payroll will be prepared based on the split you indicate there.
