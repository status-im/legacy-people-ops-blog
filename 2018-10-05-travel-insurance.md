Meetups and conferences will take you abroad from time to time. We want travel to be as hassle-free as possible for our contributors. 

We don't have a company-wide travel insurance provider (and in all likelihood, it won't make sense to get one due to our size), so please feel free to expense travel insurance from your chosen provider (up to USD 100 / EUR 100 per trip) unless you already have travel insurance in place. If getting annual multi-trip insurance is a better deal overall but cost exceeds the single trip allowance, it's fine to go ahead with that.

Travel insurance can sometimes be included as a perk with products like credit cards, bank accounts, and other insurance products, so it's worth checking your existing subscriptions as you may already be covered elsewhere.

Some insurers specialising in global travel insurance:

- [World Nomads](https://worldnomads.com/)
- [True Traveller](https://www.truetraveller.com/) (EU-focused)
- [IMG](https://www.imglobal.com/travel-medical-insurance/patriot-travel-medical-insurance) (US-based)

We'd also love to hear about your favourite insurers and travel tips!
