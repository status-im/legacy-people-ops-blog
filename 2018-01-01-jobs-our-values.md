The goal of Status is widespread adoption of the decentralized web. It’s no small feat and we identified our guiding lights throughout the way -  a set of ideas and principles that act as tools. Tools for thinking, for communication, and for decentralized decision making, and that help us staying true to ourselves when - inevitably - dealing with daily challenges and confusion. 

We spent several weeks, if not months, to collectively compile a first draft of the things we believe in:

- **Liberty** - the sovereignty of individuals.
- **Censorship Resistance** - free flow of information.
- **Security** - guaranteed by new security methods and technologies.
- **Privacy** - the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.
- **Transparency** - no border between our core contributors and our community.Openness - the software we create is a public good.
- **Decentralization** - maximizing the number of individuals who have control.
- **Inclusivity** -  ease of use, but also socially - by permissionless participation, investing in education, and more.
- **Continuance** -  exist and improve, without the stewardship of a single entity.
- **Resourcefulness** - fight bureaucracy and inefficiencies within the organization.

You can read more about the principles [here](https://our.status.im/our-principles/). If you believe in what we do and how we do it, we’d love to hear from you.
