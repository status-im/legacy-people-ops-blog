Working at Status can be a unique experience: *remote work and a non-traditional organisation. *

We’ve heard from a few folks that they would appreciate help managing stress so we’ve secured some accounts with Headspace, one of the leaders in this space. At its core, Headspace is an app that focuses on mindfulness and meditation and has a range of tailored workouts for the mind. There’s research ([here](https://www.headspace.com/science/meditation-research): [https://www.headspace.com/science/meditation-research](https://www.headspace.com/science/meditation-research)) that their app can positively impact stress, focus, mood and work. 

Whilst meditation won’t be for everyone, we hope that some of you will find Headspace useful - especially given the somewhat unique mix of remote work, pre-launch and unusual organisation we are juggling.
