If you're someone who gets a kick from continuing to learn and grow, we want to be supportive of your aspirations, whilst also being cognisant of spending restrictions currently in place.

We offer an annual learning budget of EUR 150 for each CC which can be used towards things like books, conferences, or online courses. Speak with your lead to request additional budget if needed.

Please [file this expense through Expensify](__GHOST_URL__/filing-expenses/) and indicate what learning it is for in the comment box.

### Team leads:

If there's room in your budget, you can approve learning requests directly, otherwise, please raise any proposed additional costs in your regular budget meeting.
