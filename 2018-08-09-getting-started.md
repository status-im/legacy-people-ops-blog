# start

Wooot??? You did not install the Status Mobile App on your phone yet? Do it right now! (We now also have [Status Desktop](https://discuss.status.im/t/living-our-principles-drinking-our-own-champagne-saying-goodbye-to-slack-and-hello-to-status/407) - drinking our own champagne - yay!)

Write down your recovery seed and store it in a safe place!

# connect

Connect with three or more people by entering their [Contact Code](__GHOST_URL__/status-direct/) in the Status Mobile App:

Home tab -> + -> Start new chat -> Enter contact code

# transact

Request or send some ETH and SNT from and to a contact within the Status Mobile App. Need crypto? @jason will be happy to help!

# store

Get and setup your hardware wallet (Nano Ledger S, Trezor, …). Feel free to expense a hardware wallet if you don't already own one, or ask @rajanie as she may already have one to send you.

Store your recovery seed safely!

# earn

Receive your salary (or a part of it) in crypto. Find more information [here](__GHOST_URL__/getting-paid/).

Collect a bounty by contributing code on [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/profile/status-im).

# buy

Buy some ETH from a friend, colleague or on an exchange.

For exchanges, try [https://coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com) or [https://bity.com](https://bity.com). Pass their KYC procedures and exchange some fiat to crypto. Don’t leave substantial amounts on any centralized exchange! Transfer a bit of ETH to the Status Mobile App and the larger amounts to your hardware wallet.

Privacy hint: Ethereum transactions are public. You can look them up here: [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io). Whoever knows your public key (your Ethereum address), can trace your transactions.

# gift

Instead of gifting a flower bouquet or some booze, better transfer a Cryptokitty, ETH or SNT to your friend, neighbor, girlfriend, mother, father, siblings, uncles, aunts, and grandparents, bowling club fellows, waiter, landlord, tax advisor, nurse… well, encourage everybody to download the Status Mobile App and get them started with crypto.

Be a pioneer! Encourage them to do spread the word.

# invest&contribute

# buidl

Try [https://embark.status.im](https://embark.status.im) and browse [https://www.ethereum.org](https://www.ethereum.org) to find out how.

# learn

There is much more to crypto than digitally transferring and storing money. Fall into the rabbit hole of crypto and become mad about it.

> “We’re all mad here.”

> – Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland.

Understand crypto and engage in discussions on how to apply it to make 1) things better and 2) better things. Do some research. Start by googling your questions.
