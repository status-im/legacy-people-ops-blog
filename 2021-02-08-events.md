Planning to attend an event or conference or have a team offsite? Not sure where to start for getting budget and attendance approval? Read on...

### July 2021 update

Travel is still complicated due to Covid restrictions. If you're thinking to organise or join an event or meetup, please check the specific (re-)entry restrictions that are applicable to you. Keep in mind that governmental guidelines are changing as frequently as every few days, and that they can impact your travel plans severely. 

If you want to get a sense of where it would be possible to meet, please check out [Trooptravel](https://www.trooptravel.com/). Instructions and links to sign up [here](https://discuss.status.im/t/finding-meetup-locations/2218). 

### If the travel falls within your team budget:

- 
Each team has their own budget. As a starting point, check in with your team lead about the event/meetup you want to attend. Make sure that the business need for the event, and costs associated, make sense.

- 
If the event/conference fits within your existing team budget and your team lead agrees, just proceed to creating a post as indicated below.

- 
**Create a post about the event in Discuss**.

- Example [post](https://discuss.status.im/t/ethdenver-feb-15-17-2019/922)

### If the travel falls outside your existing team budget:

1. As a starting point, check in with your team lead about the event/meetup you want to attend. Sanity check the business need for the event and the cost to Status.
2. Create a request. Just fill in the details below:

- **Destination/Dates**
- **Costs** (Flight, accommodation, ground transport, event ticket if applicable, meals, etc.)
- **Business impact** (What is the business reason/ benefit to Status for your attending? just one line will do)
- (If applicable: who else from Status should attend or is attending).

1. Submit the request in the **#travel-requests channel**. Tag (as cc) your team lead. From there, your team lead can give a simple üëç to confirm the request makes sense or ask additional questions; and People Ops & Finance can ask any necessary questions or suggest adjustments.
2. When your proposal is approved, then please **publish a post with all the details of the event to Discuss** to let people know you will be attending.

## FAQ

**What happened to the Conference Budget that was previously available?**

We've removed that policy in 2019 whilst in financial battle mode - it didn't make sense to allow for automatic approval of trips while making considered decisions on all of our spending across the board. Since then, attending conferences is covered under this general `Events` policy - we'd still like to support people in their professional development endeavours where possible, but even if we're in much better financial shape, we should observe how things evolve before making decisions around that.
