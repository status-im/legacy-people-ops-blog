We love our Principles and aim to weave these into everything we do here at Status. Here's how we're bringing these to life in our daily actions.

### Liberty

> We believe in the right of individuals to have autonomy and responsibility over their own lives. We aim to maximize social, political, and economic freedoms. Status is an agnostic platform.

We work to enable a culture of free and asynchronous work for Status contributors - wherever, whenever. We support autonomy and ownership of projects, and empower contributors to make judgment calls when those are needed. We will invest in continuous learning, and offer a variety of compensation models to give the broadest flexibility possible for contributors to get involved in a way that best suits them. We have made a deliberate decision to eschew costly perks and benefits in favour of a straightforward base remuneration to give each contributor the economic freedom to allocate their money in a way that best fits their circumstances.

### Censorship resistance

> We aim to avoid the suppression of information. No content is under surveillance. One of the design goals of Ethereum is to be censorship resistant, and we should provide the same guarantees across Status.

People Ops is not here to police the community, but we can help by setting best practices (not rules). As an example - we can help set travel cost guidelines for someone attending a conference, but ultimately it’s down to the individual to decide how much of the organisation’s funds to spend.

We make sure everyone in the team has a voice, we support psychological safety, and do not penalize anyone for speaking up. We want to foster a culture of respect for diverging opinions. We will aim to use open source software where possible when doing our work.

### Security

> We don’t compromise on security when building features. We will use state of the art and research new security methods and technologies to make strong security guarantees.

We protect sensitive people data (e.g. bank information) by following proper and stringent security protocols. We will establish documentation for security best practices when setting up a remote workstation. 

### Privacy

> The power to selectively reveal oneself to the world. Protecting privacy in communication and transactions, as well as the right to total anonymity.

We share no individual data without the prior consent of the individual. We will endeavour to request the bare minimum of personal information from contributors that allows People Ops to provide support, whilst also respecting the contributor’s right to privacy.

Trade-offs: we are bound to comply with reasonable legislation per country - e.g. requesting real names and social security numbers for contributors in Germany.

### Free culture

> The software we create is a public good. It will be made available via a free and open source license, for anyone to share, modify and benefit from.

We share all People Ops data/initiatives publicly across the organisation, removing only sensitive PII first. 

### Decentralization

> We will minimize centralization across both the software and the organization. In other words: Maximize the number of physical computers composing the network, and maximize the number of individuals who have control over the system(s) we are building.

We aim to minimize centralisation across People practices (e.g. hiring, performance management) to only when critical to operating. Where decisions have to be centralised (e.g. compensation), we ensure that these decisions are informed by objective and decentralised input. We encourage contributors from any other part of the organization to take initiative or be part of People Ops projects. We stay committed to removing unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy from the organisation.

### Inclusivity

> We believe in fair and widespread access to our software, with an emphasis on ease of use. This also extends to social inclusivity, inviting participation in the organization, and investing in educational efforts.

We model and support a culture where everyone (both core contributor and community member) has the freedom to participate. We attract talent from diverse backgrounds and cultures, and encourage positive and respectful communication. We remove barriers to participation, and create avenues into the Status community.

### Continuance

> We aim to create software that will continue to exist and improve without the stewardship of a single entity or any current team members.

We will curate a culture of independence from Status amongst core contributors in how we structure, contract, and utilise core contributor positions.

Trade off: Our current salary model of compensation means that we are required to have legal entities in some jurisdictions. We will aim to minimise our reliance on entities in the future wherever possible, whilst also being cognizant of our compliance obligations related to them in the here and now.

### Resourcefulness

> Doing more with less. By optimizing what we have to work with, we aim to solve problems in the most effective way possible at lower economic costs (capital, time and resources).

We provide logistics support to our events program, to make the most efficient use of organisational funds. We are diligent in adding resources/funds, and only hire salaried positions where we view a critical need for a salaried person versus other options.
