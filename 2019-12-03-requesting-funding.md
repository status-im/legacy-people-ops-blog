## When to use this guide

From time to time, you might need to request additional funds to get work done.

As a general principle we ask teams to anticipate their spending as part of the monthly budgeting exercise (this is so that teams can be self-sufficient and make their own decisions about spending without having to check each individual expense with Finance).

This guide is about how to request funding when:

- The team budget has been exceeded and additional funds are required; or
- Unanticipated/new expenses arise; or
- Approval is needed on a time-sensitive basis, that can't wait for regular team budget reviews.

This applies to all mechanisms of receiving funding, including:

- Putting an expense on the company credit card (more info [here](__GHOST_URL__/the-company-credit-card/))
- Getting crypto (SNT/ETH) paid out to your wallet.
- Putting a non-routine expense on your personal card and having it reimbursed via Expensify.
