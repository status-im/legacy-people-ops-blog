This information applies to core contributors (check with People Ops if you're not sure whether this applies to you). We do occasionally have loan laptops available to all contributors - please ping People Ops if you need one and we'll get one sent across to you.

We all work remotely and everyone should have the tools they need to do their best work. You can set yourself up with devices as indicated below. Please check in with us ahead of buying devices for reimbursement, as we may already have similar recycled devices in stock.

When you get a new device, make sure to add it as an `Asset` under your profile in BambooHR, specifying the serial number, make, model, and purchase details.

At the 3 year mark, if your device needs an upgrade, ping People Ops.

The device allowance is on offer to give you essential hardware for your role. It's non-transferrable for other expenses (e.g. a tablet) in case you don't make use of it.

# Devices

**Laptop**

Laptops are reimbursable up to a maximum value of EUR 2000 or equivalent local currency. If that's not sufficient for your current role needs, please discuss with People Ops.

We currently have the [following](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A2jqn3Ch-zDyHFRnqMaoWwVHKBAPgH2p4sgEWk7Jwyo/edit?ts=5c2cbe52#gid=0) loan laptops available.

**Additional laptops**

Where there’s a development need for additional devices, it’s ok to purchase more than one. For any additional devices, please speak to your lead who can coordinate that the team as a whole has all the devices it needs for testing.

@team leads - you can see a list of all Status-bought devices and owners [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YJBDqY5KC18gjc45trDbiqynn7xa3R6SL8WzmlNS8wY/edit#gid=0). If you’re happy that the team needs more devices (and there currently aren’t any loan devices in stock) you can approve the purchase. This comes out of a central budget and isn’t factored in to your individual team budget.

**Mic headset**

You may find yourself getting involved in presenting updates during our Town Halls. If so, please consider checking your mic sound quality in advance with a fellow team member to make sure that it's clear. You might find it useful to buy an inexpensive but functional mic headset. The [Sennheiser SC30](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSennheiser-Culture-Wideband-Headset-SC30-USB-CTRL%2Fdp%2FB00D4LBOV6%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fs%3Delectronics%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1527061827%26sr%3D1-2%26keywords%3Dsennheiser%2Bsc30&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF253h5wSUSuO15WE8Bi990h_OjFQ) comes highly recommended for its noise-cancelling mic.

**Security**

Safety first! Check out this [list](https://hackmd.io/w05YbPzJSHG1lnS5fSS4Eg) of security precautions you can take to secure your devices.

**Keycard**

Yes, of course we want you to have one and to use it! Ping Guy-Luis and he will create a code for you to be able to get one for free delivered at your doorstep.

**Other Devices**

Please get approval from your team lead first, then add a comment in Expensify with details of the approval. Please only request other devices if there is strong business justification for your using them (an example might be a tablet for a designer who needs one to sketch, or a printer for an operations team member that needs to frequently sign and send company documentation).

## Germany employees

If you’re a German employee, please be sure to buy your devices via an invoice addressed to the German entity (Status Research & Development Deutschland GmbH, ℅ Cormoran GmbH, Am Zirkus 2, 10117 Berlin, Germany). The invoice should be submitted to [billing@status.im](mailto:billing@status.im).

# FAQ

**What if my start date is in the future?**

You can order your things as soon as two weeks before your start date, and no need to wait for your probation period to be over.

**What if I leave Status?**

Please check out [this](__GHOST_URL__/offboarding/) offboarding guide for your options on recycling or buying back your laptop.

**How do I get reimbursed?**

When buying gear at an Apple store, you may receive a discount in certain countries if you mention that it is a business purchase while providing the company details of Status (or optionally your company details in case you are working based on a contractor agreement).

Please submit your costs via Expensify, with an invoice including the device serial number. You must add your devices to BambooHR, before the report can be reimbursed (this applies to computers only!)

**What if I don't have enough funds to buy the device prior to reimbursement?**

If cashflow is an issue and you'd prefer not to outlay the cash upfront for your new device, please ping People Ops who'll help you with buying the device.

**What happens if I accidentally damage a device?**

Please obtain a quote for a repair and let People Ops know - if the cost is reasonable (e.g. less than ~75% of the trade-in value of the asset) we would ask you to go ahead and get the device repaired, and submit the repair expense cost for reimbursement.
