A project tasked with bug fixing the experience of contributing to Status.

People Ops is a resource to empower contributors to do their best work. We aim to optimise anything in the working experience of Status core contributors that relates to:

- Happiness
- Wellness
- Engagement, and
- Productivity.

We recently had a hangout with twenty core contributors and asked the (very open-ended!) question: *what could be improved at Status?*

Here's some of the things you told us:

1. **Info overload** - there are so many places to read and contribute - this is the biggest pain point right now. Could there be better centralisation or curation of content?
2. **Slack feels urgent and overwhelming** - you can miss a lot if you walk away for a day, there are lots of notifications and it can be distracting. We could maybe focus on better Slack etiquette/guidelines/tips and consideration of moving long-form discussions elsewhere.

Idea: What happens if we stop using Slack for a week?
3. **Finding information** - people spend lots of time searching. It's hard to find files etc., where is it sitting - on Google? Is it a link? Feels like there could be a better reference tool for consolidating/searching information.
4. **Asking for PR reviews** - sometimes PRs feel like they sit waiting for reviews that don't happen timely.

Thanks everyone that shared their thoughts and feedback in the call! We'll mull on these ideas and look for ways we can resolve these blockers. We can't promise we can fix it all, but we'll give it our best shot.

We'll be sending out engagement surveys to give everyone a chance to share their feedback directly. As per our discussion in the hangout, these are fine to get further feedback, but questions should be asked sparingly, and in a way that's quick to answer.
