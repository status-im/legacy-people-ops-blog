Why [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/)? It's decentralised and built on the Ethereum blockchain.

### How it works

To use Livepeer, your laptop needs to have Livepeer and OBS installed, and you should go through [steps](https://github.com/livepeer/wiki/wiki/Blueprint:-set-up-a-broadcasting-node-using-Livepeer-and-OBS) to create a streaming node, and configure OBS to broadcast on Livepeer.

We broadcast on the [crypto.livepeer.tv](https://media.livepeer.org/channels/0xcAFA695C965e5B143341376185e13e03F17788A3) channel, which is also used by other crypto projects.

### Getting help

Getting set up to broadcast on Livepeer is a bit more complicated than [activating a YouTube live feed](__GHOST_URL__/broadcasting-live-on-youtube/). As such, you can get help from the following people whose laptops are set up to broadcast:

**Due to the fact that broadcasts need to be scheduled in collaboration with the team at Livepeer (and using a shared tv channel on their hosted node), it's not possible to set up a Livepeer stream at short notice. You should let whoever is helping you with the broadcast know at least a week in advance of your scheduled broadcast date. It's possible your chosen date may not be available on Livepeer's calendar, so you may need to be flexible.**

For this reason, Livepeer broadcasts work best for predictable, recurring events.
