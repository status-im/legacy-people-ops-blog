In this exciting new post-Slack world, here's the lowdown on how you can stay connected.

## Find people using the Status Direct directory

The directory is [here](__GHOST_URL__/status-direct/). To get yourself listed, please add your Status contact code to the `Personal` tab in your BambooHR profile. This info will then automatically sync through to Status Direct.

## Demystify anonymous animal names

The three word anonymised profile names in Status are based on a random name [deriving](https://discuss.status.im/t/choosing-a-unique-three-word-name/613) from your public key. Disorientated and can't tell your breams from your broncos? Check out (and add yourself to!) [this](https://notes.status.im/Zt0Lo2r8R9S7pZC1PLn06A) list of core contributors and their anonymous names/ENS usernames.

## Get an ENS username

[Score](https://our.status.im/ethereum-name-service-now-available-in-status/) a human readable address to help others easily find you. All for a bargainous 10 SNT.

## Jump into Status channels

Here's a [list](https://notes.status.im/status-channels) of where people are gathering and chatting in Status. Hop on, or spin up your own discussion.

## Trial out Discord with us

Request an invite link from Ceri. We're running a trial of Discord in parallel with using Status as our long term messenger. We're not mandating which to use - some people use one or the other, or both. Channels are bridged between various chat clients (some teams use Telegram & Gitter). The bridging will help you keep up with discussions even if you only use one chat client.
