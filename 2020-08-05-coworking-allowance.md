The coworking allowance offers core contributors some flexibility to find a workspace different from your home office if needed. It's non-transferrable for other expenses in case you don't make use of it.

You can expense up to EUR 250 (or local currency equivalent) per month for coworking costs (any coworking space rental/hotdesk/access pass).

You can also include the coffee you consume at the co-working space.

You can't use the allowance for:

- Covering additional bills arising from you working from home.
- Your internet/broadband costs.
- Meals or drinks outside working hours or for take-away.
- Meals or drinks for people accompanying you that don't work at Status.
- Gratuities.

> üò° An example of a non-claimable expense: EUR 0-250 consumed on drinks at a space when you are not contributing to the Status project.

Please keep the invoices/receipts and submit your costs through Expensify as per the [expense reimbursement guidelines](__GHOST_URL__/src/finance/expense-reimbursement.md), specifying Coworking as the Category detailing the expense in the comments field of your expense line item.

If your coworking cost is above budget, please only expense up to that amount in your expense claim.

Please also consider that (for smaller/less frequent coworking expenses), our minimum threshold for submitting an expense report is EUR 50. As such, we'd ask you to group coffee receipts into one batch of at least EUR 50 before submitting them for processing.
