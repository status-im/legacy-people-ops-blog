# Expanding my horizons

I was always terrified of the sea, and if you told me years ago I'd end up learning to sail, I would not have believed you. Fast forward, and I now know how wonderful it is to catch the wind in your sails and set off towards the open ocean.

I'm a lousy sailor, but this story always reminds me that we are all wonderful, whole beings, with endless capabilities and potential to re-write our own stories. Sometimes you just have to get outside your comfort zone.

Coming to Status felt like slipping my mooring lines and setting off into the vast unknown - there is a whole world out there to get immersed in that I'm still only scratching the surface of. I'm so excited to be here, and everything I see and experience in this wonderful community of people tells me this adventure was meant to be.

# Working with me

*What qualities do you particularly value in people who work with you?*

- Openness
- Enthusiasm / energy / humour
- Willingness to try new things
- Integrity

*What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?*

I’m restless by nature. In my work life this looks like an almost compulsive need to move things forward - execute on projects, fix problems, achieve goals. I try not to be too perfectionist, and I hope this restlessness doesn’t make me difficult to work with.

*What drives you nuts?*

We all have flaws, and a group of people with diverse needs and perspectives coming together has the potential to generate conflict. I’m quite good at rationalising that in a workplace setting and not letting it get to me.

*What’s your take on learning & development?*

Nobody comes to work to do the same thing day after day and remain static. As an organisation, we owe it to our team members to invest in their learning, experience, and delight, whether they stay for two months, two years, or longer.

*What’s the best way to communicate with you?*

Any way you feel comfortable with. I genuinely enjoy chatting to people and being available to listen. You can chat to me in confidence, and I’ll be happy to guide you, or just be there to listen if you need it.

*What’s the best way to convince you to do something?*

Be excited and passionate about the idea. Enthusiasm is infectious! I also think making a strong business case backed up with data is helpful to that end.

*How do you like to give and get feedback?*

In any way possible. A healthy flow of feedback is so important in a distributed setting.

I love people being honest with me if there’s something I’m messing up. No need to take me aside or phrase it gently, just come out and tell me if my work is not up to par.

*What are your quirks?*

Probably extremely self-critical - I never think my work is good enough.

*How can people earn an extra gold star with you?*

Just be yourself.

Cheers for reading! Feel free to ask me if you have any questions!
