*Take the time you need in your first weeks to browse resources, chat to colleagues, and do the background reading that allows you to feel comfortable with the organisation and context. It's a lot to take in, but a worthwhile investment!*

# A good place to start - set up instant messaging

## Discord

Request an invite link from @terry if you aren't there yet.

# Now what?

There's no prescriptive recipe for success on your first day, but the following 7 steps should get you feeling right at home in no time:

1. 
Take a look through the action items assigned to you in BambooHR, these will help you get familiarised and get access to essential tools.

2. 
Jump on Discord and Ping in #general or #people-ops and say hello then drop into the #intros channel and tell us about you by posting an intro video.

We're always excited when new people join and we love to get to know you more.

Some great topics to cover are:

Who you are and where you are located

What excites you about Status

What did you do prior to joining Status

What are your passions/hobbies

Bonus points for fun facts about yourself.

The video can be between 1-3 minutes max.

3. 
Chat with your team lead. They'll probably already have set some time to introduce you to what you will be working on and your team. Ask them about other folks that you should get to know in your first days.

4. 
Find your team, drop by their channel, and see what work is scoped out for you in your first few weeks.

5. 
Have a read through resources like this site, [Discuss](https://discuss.status.im/), [Docs](https://status.im/docs/), and [Our Status](https://our.status.im/), to get a feel for the latest happenings and key info.

6. 
...and if you have any questions, ping people-ops. They're more than happy to help you navigate through the chaos and welcome you with a virtual coffee!

Congrats - that's day 1 done! Relax, kick back, and we'll see you again tomorrow üôåüèª
