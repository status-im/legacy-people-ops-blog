Hiring ([see Hiring Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FJJpuPleu6_EAdgf1_XOQFBAbBBewQmWWOl9oy96d_I/edit#))

1. Once you've identified a hiring need, work with PeopleOps to determine the type of hire that you need (the candidate profile, full/part time, salary estimate, etc)

3. 
#### Finance

1. 
Compensation

1. 
We try to balance giving leads ownership of compensation matters with also having an overall fair and equitable distribution of salaries across Status as a whole.

2. 
As a Lead, you'll be involved in compensation discussions at certain points:

1. 
Upon hiring a new contributor.

2. 
During any regular cycle of compensation review we hold (expected once per year).

3. 
If you believe anÂ  ad-hoc compensation adjustment is required (i..e increased salary, one-off bonus) you'll need to bring it up with Carl/Jarrad who serve as the maintainers over the overall distribution.

4. 
For smaller bonuses, and rewards, use the Kudos dapp to reward your team.
