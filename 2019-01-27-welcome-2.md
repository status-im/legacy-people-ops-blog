> *Today, when you are first exposed to Status, you might see an instant messenger and wonder, "What's the big deal? After all it’s just another instant messenger right? What makes Status different and more importantly why should I bother working on it?"*
> 
> **One word: Decentralization**
> 
> Decentralization has the potential fundamentally to change the way we organize socially and to rebuild the Internet as it was originally imagined - a commons for innovation. By decentralizing all the things, we are changing the very foundation of civilization, providing a new infrastructural base that impacts everything else above, from our greatest institutions to our daily social interactions.
> 
> Status is our gateway to this new world.
