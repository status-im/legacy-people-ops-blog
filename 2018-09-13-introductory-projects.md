We're building out new pathways to bring more awesome contributors into Status core.

Working on an `introductory project` with us is one of these pathways - a lightweight, flexible, small-scope way for us to get to know each other via some real-world collaboration. You'll be welcomed into the fold and will work alongside Status core contributors during your project.

The time we have together allows us both to make an informed decision on any subsequent long-term partnership.

As our thank you for your time, we offer a small hourly stipend for your project work.

## How it works

1. You'll receive an email from People Ops with information on a scoped project, series of tasks, or brief, the project hourly rate, and the Slack handle for the Status contributor(s) you'll be working with.
2. You'll receive an email inviting you to join our Slack workspace. Feel free to use a pseudonym or nickname if that feels more comfortable. Once you've arrived in Slack, head to #newbies and say hey - People Ops will be happy to make some introductions (or feel free to go directly to your team/buddy if you know where to find them already). 
3. And you're off! You'll work on your project at a time and place convenient to you. You may find it useful to learn more about how we work by reading up on our [Principles](__GHOST_URL__/status-principles/), [Code of Conduct](__GHOST_URL__/code-of-conduct/), [Working schedule](__GHOST_URL__/working-schedule/), and [how the later trial period works](__GHOST_URL__/the-trial-period/) if you go on to be a core contributor.
4. Try to make your work as visible and accessible as possible, and communicate early and often with progress updates. It might be helpful to share a time estimate for completing your project (this will vary greatly from one person to another depending on Â schedule and capacity).
5. Once your project is complete, let People Ops and all your fellow team collaborators know. People Ops will ask your co-collaborators to submit an evaluation of your work.
6. If the `Introductory project` goes well (you like what you see at Status, and your fellow contributors vouch for your work), we'll invite you for a chat with either Carl (our co-founder) or Nabil (operations lead).
7. If those chats go well, we'll look to make you a full time offer as a core contributor with Status, and we'll connect with you to reach an agreeable rate/salary for your core contributor tenure. The rate you're offered for the `Introductory project` is a universal flat fee and has no bearing on the salary discussion later. The reason we use a flat fee is to avoid any protracted contracting discussions that wouldn't make much sense while a longer-term arrangement is still not set in stone.

### Invoicing for your project hours

Please see [this](__GHOST_URL__/billing-for-freelance-project-work/) guide on invoicing (TL;DR: send your invoice before the 20th of each month to billing@status.im).

### Questions?

If we can help you with any logistical questions, or to offer support in planning the `Introductory project` around your existing commitments, feel free to Ping People Ops any time, we're always happy to help :)

Good luck!

## FAQ

### Will you be issuing a services agreement for this work?

No - as these projects are short term and limited scope in nature, we do not ask for a contract to be signed. If you'd feel more comfortable having one in place, People Ops will be happy to create a services agreement for you.

### How quickly do you need the project completed?

As with all work at Status, your project is self-paced according to your own schedule and availability. We understand that you probably have other commitments outside of this project, and we're not expecting your full focus :) As a rule of thumb, 6 weeks is a common project timeframe, but you could choose to complete it in more or less time than that.

### What might the project look like?

This can really vary depending on your area of functional specialism. It could be one single project, a series of linked tasks, a brief, or a series of prompts to get involved in a current project. All projects will relate to actual ongoing work (i.e. - we don't create projects for the sake of them, we want you to see Status in its true form, not just a neatly presented part of it) :) If you're worried about the scope or the time involvement, feel free to chat to us and suggest tweaking it - we're open to ideas and happy to work with you to find something that fits.

### What's the role of my buddy?

People Ops will assign you a buddy to guide you through your project and help you orientate yourself in the Statusphere, feel free to ping them anytime for help.
