We consider your first +/- 12 weeks of contributing full-time as a trial period. The trial period length varies if you're on a day/hour contributor agreement, so please do ask anyone in the People Ops team if you're not sure about how long your trial lasts or what you'll be evaluated on.

During this time you'll be treated like, and work alongside, other Status contributors - you’ll have access to the same information, software, (virtual) meetups, and learning opportunities. We’re confident that you will be a great addition, or we wouldn’t have extended an offer!

However, we have seen that sometimes things just don’t work out.

Working remotely, on new tech, with a super flexible team that’s constantly iterating and evolving, isn’t to everyone's tastes, and we want to be very upfront about what we expect from everyone in the team.

A clearly defined initial tryout will allow enough time to get to know each other and fully appreciate how we can work together. It might also be that you decide that Status isn’t what you’re looking for, and that’s okay too.

## What we expect

- We expect you to show us you can prioritize correctly, get things done, and find answers in an increasingly autonomous way. In most teams there will be a first project scoped out for you. Regardless of that being the case make sure you ask your lead from where you can start, and clarify expectations for your role / seek feedback on how you’re doing, early and regularly.
- We expect you to be accountable for your goals and deadlines. We don’t micromanage - if by any chance you realize you’re stuck, make sure to flag it, and to discuss within your team if would be best to change course.
- We don’t see each other much, and written communication is what we see the most from each other. We’d like for everyone to be clear, friendly, and helpful to everyone else.
- We expect a consistent and high volume of communication to keep your fellow contributors updated on your progress.There is no expectation that you reply to each ping immediately. Do your work and avoid interruptions, but do check your messages at least a couple of times a day, and if you know you won't have time to look into something right away, let the other party know when they can expect to have an answer, so they can organise their work efficiently too.
- Everyone should contribute to the products and to our culture. If you see anything that could be improved, and have an idea to make it better - bring it up. If you see that a co-contributor is stuck, offer to help or to ping someone who can. We’re all in this together!
- Read [this](https://medium.com/remote-work/12-qualities-to-look-for-when-hiring-remote-workers-68243ff351b0) article. It gives a sense of what qualities are most important to be successful in any role here at Status.
- For those less experienced in the blockchain/crypto space - jump in and immerse yourself in the ecosystem and get to better understand our principles and mission. This is a huge topic and we don't expect everyone to become an expert, but we would be super impressed to see that you're committed to continuously learning and developing your knowledge.
- Try to model our principles in all that you do at Status.

## Mid-Trial Feedback

When you reach the end of your first 6-8 weeks (if working full-time), consider to send [this form](https://forms.gle/pvJA1ppVyRuEDi2MA) to the people you worked more closely with. It's always good to collect feedback early so to have time to take it onboard during the reminder of the trial period.

Ping People Ops to get a copy of the feedback collected; and feel free to use your mid-trial chat with them to go through it and barinstorm ways to implement it.

## End-Trial Feedback

At the end of the trial period, People Ops'll do a feedback round and send [this](https://goo.gl/forms/clmw6Klm08OhWgX33) end-trial feedback form to your chosen group of co-contributors.

People Ops will aggregate the results within 1-2 weeks and share these back to you and your team lead in a format similar to the above. At that time, your lead will make and communicate a decision on whether your trial has been successful.

We hope for all our trials to be successful, but in case we don't see the potential for a productive future collaboration together, People Ops will then reach out to you about extending your trial or ending your contract with Status, and any relevant offboarding logistics.

## FAQs

**Who has access to the trial feedback?**

The People Ops team, your team lead, Carl, Jarrad.

**Who makes the decision on trial outcome?**

The contributor's team lead, who is responsible for the hiring/staffing decisions on their project. People Ops acts as a faciliator in the process.

**Can I give feedback anonymously?**

Yes - you can leave the `Name` field blank in the feedback form if you'd like to provide fully anonymous feedback.

**How do you evaluate whether a trial is successful?**

This is based on the feedback received via the trial process. We try to ask a diverse set of questions in the feedback form to get a mix of data points - numerical, qualitative, comparative. All responses received are aggregated. Work output not showing advancement of the Principles, nor important qualities like productivity, autonomy, or visibility, would be indicators of a poor role fit. Contribution not being impactful overall to Status's objectives, or developmental feedback not being addressed would also be reasons to end the trial.

**Why do you ask so many contributors for feedback?**

The response rate is typically ~60%. We want to get as many voices and opinions involved in the process to make the process as fair as possible.

**How will I know what happens with someone's trial?**

We want to be sensitive to each person's privacy by not discussing details about their performance with other contributors. As such, we don't (at this point in time) announce whether trials were successful or not, but we're open to changing that if people would prefer this was made transparent. We'd likely not be able to give specific details of why a trial outcome was reached, though.

**Can I give trial feedback even if I wasn't directly asked?**

100%! You can share [trial](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9_P-F36U3ftuhcKkoXZa3yAi9bSRwG9E7pB-O0fHIVN7x6A/viewform) feedback anytime.

**This process seems pretty centralised, what's up with that?**

You're not wrong! The trial feedback process was an interim solution to try to make hiring as high quality and consistent across Status, but it has stuck in the absence of better alternatives being identified. It's far from perfect, and we're always looking to adapt and iterate it, so [share your ideas](https://discuss.status.im/t/trial-periods-what-next/795) with People Ops and we'll incorporate them!
