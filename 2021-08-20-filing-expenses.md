### How to get reimbursed for expenses?

In order to be reimbursed for expenses incurred on behalf of Status during the development of the project, you will need to invoice Status and submit a report obtained through [Expensify](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expensify.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGpm5mx9v1hLOvSKTm5s7_iEpA4OA) with the details of these expenses.

#### Getting set up with Expensify

We use Expensify to report and store the expense receipts incurred on behalf of Status during the development of the project.

You only need to create an account with your status.im email address and Expensify will ask you to join the Status organization. Please input your full name as it appears in your BambooHR profile when setting up your Expensify account.

You can also download the Expensify mobile app for when you're on the go.

#### Submitting an expense report through Expensify

For the Finance team to be able to approve the expense reimbursements, all expense reports should be submitted by the 10th of the month before submitting the monthly invoice on the 15th.

Please follow these links if you need help with [creating expenses](https://community.expensify.com/discussion/4560/how-to-create-expenses-manually) and [submitting reports](https://community.expensify.com/discussion/4561/how-to-submit-a-report/p1?new=1) on Expensify

If you would need further help with the creation and submission of expense reports, please contact the Finance team and they will be able to guide you through the process.

#### Adding the expenses to your monthly invoice

The submitted report from Expensify will show the total for each expense category. For example, if you have several costs in one category, Expensify will show the following:

**Your invoice should only contain the total per category, not each expense item.**

To avoid any delays with the expense claim approval, please ensure your invoice has the same category names as the Expensify reports.

If you would like to set up these categories in your accounting software, please ask the Finance team for the complete list of expense categories.

If you need to share the report with your accountant, you can download a PDF report with your expenses by clicking on the top right corner and then on the “Download” icon:

### General Guidance

You will always need to submit a receipt with each expense you log. Make sure to take photos or keep digital receipts handy - missing receipts might end up in your reports not being approved.

Please select a Category for each expense, and include a comment indicating how the expense is business-related, including any additional context that will help the expense reviewer identify that the expense is appropriate. As an example:

- Team Event Expense

- Category: Events
- Description: "Devcon Conference, Berlin - Taxi from LHR airport to conference with 1 other team member, Joe"

- Another Team Event Expense

- Category: Meals & Drinks
- Description: "People Ops Meetup - Evening meal on May 26th with 3 others: John, Jane, Joseph"

We suggest submitting an expense reimbursement report only when the total value is above USD 50.

Expense reimbursements are paid together with the monthly compensation invoice. If you have questions or concerns regarding the expense reimbursement date, please contact the Finance team, and they will be happy to help you with that.

For any other questions related to this process, please feel free to ping the Finance team in the #ask-finance channel or through an email to [billing@status.im](mailto:billing@status.im).
